ETH Chain (BridgeETH) - Lock tokens

1. User: Token.approve(BridgeETH_ETH, 100)
2. User: BridgeETH_ETH.deposit(TOKEN_ETH, 100) 
   → tokens locked in BridgeETH_ETH, emits Deposit(user, 100)
3. Relayer sees Deposit → calls BridgeETH_BASE.burnedOnOppositeChain(user, 100)
   → sets pendingBalance[user] = 100 on Base

Base Chain (BridgeETH) - Mint wrapped

4. User: BridgeETH_BASE.withdraw(RPandeycoin, 100) 
   → mints 100 RPandeycoin to user (if pendingBalance >= 100)

Reverse: Base → ETH

5. User: BridgeETH_BASE.burn(RPandeycoin, 100)
   → burns user's RPandeycoin, emits Burn(user, 100)
6. Relayer sees Burn → calls BridgeETH_ETH.burnedOnOppositeChain(user, 100)
   → sets pendingBalance[user] = 100 on ETH
7. User: BridgeETH_ETH.withdraw(TOKEN_ETH, 100)
   → transfers real tokens from bridge to user
